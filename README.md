# Payaroll_Management_System
Designed a system that inputs the data in an interactive Python GUI and stores the data into MySQL database.
This system also allows an authorized user to access, store and overwrite data in the MySQL database without even opening MySQL and typing the SQL Commands.

The Python File can be found in this repository under the name Payroll_Management.py

This file imports two modules MySQLdb and prettytable. These two external modules can be installed using the command line / terminal.
To install these modules use the commands: 

pip install mysqlclient   (or)    pip install MySQL-python
pip install prettytable
